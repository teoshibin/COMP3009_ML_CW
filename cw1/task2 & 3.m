%% all tuned models from nested cross validation scripts (6 scripts in total)

%% Task 2 & 3
% code for all the best tuned models containing the numbers of the support
% vectors and the F1 score for classification and RMSE for regression are 
% located at all the files below (.m files without prefix "demo" contain the
% same codes as mlx files)

%% Location of the code
% F1 score for classification is located at the final result section within
% all mlx
% RMSE for regression is located at the final result section within all mlx
% support vector count is at the end of the line within all mlx
